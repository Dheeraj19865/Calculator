## Calculator GUI Application

This is a simple Calculator GUI application built using Java Swing. The interface allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, between two input numbers. It is user-friendly and visually clean, with labeled input fields, operational buttons, and a result display.

### Features:
- **Input Fields:** Two text fields (`INPUT 1` and `INPUT 2`) for entering numbers.
- **Arithmetic Operations:** Buttons for performing the following operations:
  - `ADD`: Adds the two input numbers.
  - `SUBTRACT`: Subtracts the second number from the first.
  - `MULTIPLY`: Multiplies the two input numbers.
  - `DIVIDE`: Divides the first number by the second.
- **Clear Button:** Resets all input fields and the result display.
- **Result Display:** Outputs the result of the selected operation.
